# oh2019
Psych 251 project in which I replicate an experiment from a recently published paper from *Psychological Science* to provide independent, converging evidence for the reproducibility of the study. For my project, I have chosen the recently published study Oh et al. 2019 titled ["Revealing Hidden Gender Biases in Competence Impressions of Faces."](https://journals-sagepub-com.stanford.idm.oclc.org/doi/full/10.1177/0956797618813092#_i15)
