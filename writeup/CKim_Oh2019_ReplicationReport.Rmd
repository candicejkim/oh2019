##Introduction

For this project, I seek to replicate the findings of Experiment 3 of the study conducted by Oh et al. (2019) titled "Revealing Hidden Gender Biases in Competence Impressions of Faces." This study overall sought to identify the components of competence stereotype using data-driven computational models. For Experiment 3, the authors tested whether gender-related facial cues were used to judge competence. They presented participants with faces that varied on perceived competence and asked them to categorize them as male or female. THe authors found that faces manipulated to appear competent but not attractive were more likely to be classified as male, suggesting that gender bias influences competence impressions. I am interested in replicating this study, and particularly this experiment, because of my research interest in gender equity in medicine. Prior research has shown that leadership in academic medicine and specific medical specialties such as surgery are overwhelmingly male dominated. Better understanding the role of gender bias on critical factors such as perceived competence, which influences hiring decisions, promotions, and program acceptance rates, can provide insight on current gender gaps in medicine.

This reproduction study will be conducted using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) to recruit participants. The original study included 30 participants, accounting for test-retest reliability of greater than 0. The authors used face images computationally manipulated using both the competence model and the difference model to generate a pool of 350 face-image stimuli (2 models x 25 identities x 7 manipulation levels). For each face-image stimulus, participants were asked to make a forced choice of male or female. Two version of the study were created: (1) 88 competence-model faces + 87 difference-model faces and (2) 87 competence-model faces + 88 difference-model faces. Each version included unique image stimuli with no overlap of images. The 175 images for each version were presented to the participant, who was then asked to respond to the question "What is the gender of this person?" with two options male or female. To assess intrarater reliability, 25 trials from the first 175 trials were randomly repeated to bring the total of trials to 200 for each participant. Responses of participants who had a test-retest reliability less than or equal to 0 were excluded. I believe the major challenge to reproducing this study will be generating the face-image stimuli since I am not familiar with the program the authors used to create the images. Perhaps I can use the same images the authors used in their study, but I am not sure if this would be considered sufficient for this replication project. Additionally, I have not used Amazon MTurk before and have limited coding experience. As such, I am not sure how difficult it will be to create the interface needed for the 200 trials (the last 25 of which are random repeats from the first 175) and whether my coding experience will be sufficient. One potential concern I had was being able to recruit enough participants on MTurk. However, for this study, the authors included 30 participants, which seems like an attainable number.

##Methods

###Power Analysis

Original effect size, power analysis for samples to achieve 80%, 90%, 95% power to detect that effect size.  Considerations of feasibility for selecting planned sample size.

###Planned Sample

Planned sample size and/or termination rule, sampling frame, known demographics if any, preselection rules if any.

###Materials

All materials - can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Procedure	

Can quote directly from original article - just put the text in quotations and note that this was followed precisely.  Or, quote directly and just point out exceptions to what was described in the original article.

###Analysis Plan

Can also quote directly, though it is less often spelled out effectively for an analysis strategy section.  The key is to report an analysis strategy that is as close to the original - data cleaning rules, data exclusion rules, covariates, etc. - as possible.  

**Clarify key analysis of interest here**  You can also pre-specify additional analyses you plan to do.

###Differences from Original Study

Explicitly describe known differences in sample, setting, procedure, and analysis plan from original study.  The goal, of course, is to minimize those differences, but differences will inevitably occur.  Also, note whether such differences are anticipated to make a difference based on claims in the original article or subsequent published research on the conditions for obtaining the effect.

### Methods Addendum (Post Data Collection)

You can comment this section out prior to final report with data collection.

#### Actual Sample
  Sample size, demographics, data exclusions based on rules spelled out in analysis plan

#### Differences from pre-data collection methods plan
  Any differences from what was described as the original plan, or “none”.

### Confirmatory analysis

The analyses as specified in the analysis plan.  

*Side-by-side graph with original graph is ideal here*

###Exploratory analyses

Any follow-up analyses desired (not required).  

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
